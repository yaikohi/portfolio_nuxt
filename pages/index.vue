    <p class="px-12 py-4">
      I love learning and put in active effort to keep up with
      the newest technologies.
      I’ve worked on group projects with an agile team, in
      these, I communicated and developed alongside my
      teammates using scrum methodologies.
      <br />
      <br />These projects involved
      <br />- maintaining version control with git,
      <br />- writing modular, reusable, and qualitative code,
      <br />- working according to the sprint backlog,
      <br />and writing feedback, assuring quality & acceptation
      criteria, and reflecting during the retrospective
      moments of the sprints.
      <br />
      <br />Being part of an ever-evolving field and being able to
      take on new challenges, along with developing my
      own skills as a developer, are the things that keep me
      motivated and focused.
